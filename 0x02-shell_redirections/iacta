Script: 1. Prologue

"A Royale with Cheese"

1. INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING 1.

A normal Denny’s, Spires-like coffee shop in Los Angeles.
It’s about 9:00 in the morning. While the place isn’t jammed,
there’s a healthy number of people drinking coffee, munching
on bacon and eating eggs.

Two of these people are a YOUNG MAN and a YOUNG WOMAN. The
Young Man has a slight working-class English accent and, like
his fellow countryman, smokes cigarettes like they’re going
out of style.

It is impossible to tell where the Young Woman is from or how
old she is; everything she does contradicts something she did.
The boy and girl sit in a booth. Their dialogue is to be said
in a rapid-pace „HIS GIRL FRIDAY“ fashion.

YOUNG MAN
No, forget it, it’s too risky. I’m
through doin‘ that shit.

YOUNG WOMAN
You always say that, the same thing
every time: never again, I’m
through, too dangerous.

YOUNG MAN
I know that’s what I always say.
I’m always right too, but —

YOUNG WOMAN
— but you forget about it in a day
or two —

YOUNG MAN
— yeah, well, the days of me
forgittin‘ are over, and the days
of me rememberin‘ have just begun.

YOUNG WOMAN
When you go on like this, you know
what you sound like?

YOUNG MAN
I sound like a sensible fucking
man, is what I sound like.

YOUNG WOMAN
You sound like a duck.
(imitates a duck)
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack,
quack, quack…

YOUNG MAN
Well take heart, ‚cause you’re
never gonna hafta hear it again.
Because since I’m never gonna do it
again, you’re never gonna hafta
hear me quack about how I’m never
gonna do it again.

YOUNG WOMAN
After tonight.

The boy and girl laugh, their laughter putting a pause in
there, back and forth.

YOUNG MAN
(with a smile)
Correct. I got all tonight to
quack.

A WAITRESS comes by with a pot of coffee.

WAITRESS
Can I get anybody anymore coffee?

YOUNG WOMAN
Oh yes, thank you.

The Waitress pours the Young Woman’s coffee. The Young Man
lights up another cigarette.

YOUNG MAN
I’m doin‘ fine.

The Waitress leaves. The Young Man takes a drag off of his
smoke. The Young Woman pours a ton of cream and sugar into
her coffee.

The Young Man goes right back into it.

YOUNG MAN
I mean the way it is now, you’re
takin‘ the same fuckin‘ risk as
when you rob a bank. You take more
of a risk. Banks are easier!
Federal banks aren’t supposed to
stop you anyway, during a robbery.
They’re insured, why should they
care? You don’t even need a gun in
a federal bank.
I heard about this guy, walked into
a federal bank with a portable
phone, handed the phone to the
teller, the guy on the other end of
the phone said: „We got this guy’s
little girl, and if you don’t give
him all your money, we’re gonna
kill ‚er.“

YOUNG WOMAN
Did it work?

YOUNG MAN
Fuckin‘ A it worked, that’s what
I’m talkin‘ about! Knucklehead
walks in a bank with a telephone,
not a pistol, not a shotgun, but a
fuckin‘ phone, cleans the place
out, and they don’t lift a fuckin‘
finger.

YOUNG WOMAN
Did they hurt the little girl?

YOUNG MAN
I don’t know. There probably never
was a little girl — the point of
the story isn’t the little girl.
The point of the story is they
robbed the bank with a telephone.

YOUNG WOMAN
You wanna rob banks?

YOUNG MAN
I’m not sayin‘ I wanna rob banks,
I’m just illustrating that if we
did, it would be easier than what
we been doin‘.

YOUNG WOMAN
So you don’t want to be a bank
robber?

YOUNG MAN
Naw, all those guys are goin‘ down
the same road, either dead or
servin‘ twenty.

YOUNG WOMAN
And no more liquor stores?

YOUNG MAN
What have we been talking about?
Yeah, no-more-liquor-stores.
Besides, it ain’t the giggle it
usta be. Too many foreigners own
liquor stores. Vietnamese,
Koreans, they can’t fuckin‘ speak
English. You tell ‚em: „Empty out
the register,“ and they don’t know
what it fuckin‘ means. They make
it too personal. We keep on, one
of those gook motherfuckers‘ gonna
make us kill ‚em.

YOUNG WOMAN
I’m not gonna kill anybody.

YOUNG MAN
I don’t wanna kill anybody either.
But they’ll probably put us in a
situation where it’s us of them.
And if it’s not the gooks, it these
old Jews who’ve owned the store for
fifteen fuckin‘ generations. Ya
got Grandpa Irving sittin‘ behind
the counter with a fuckin‘ Magnum.
Try walkin‘ into one of those
stores with nothin‘ but a
telephone, see how far it gets you.
Fuck it, forget it, we’re out of
it.

YOUNG WOMAN
Well, what else is there, day jobs?

YOUNG MAN
(laughing)
Not this life.

YOUNG WOMAN
Well what then?

He calls to the Waitress.

YOUNG MAN
Garcon! Coffee!

Then looks to his girl.

YOUNG MAN
This place.

The Waitress comes by, pouring him some more.

WAITRESS
(snotty)
„Garcon“ means boy.

She splits.

YOUNG WOMAN
Here? It’s a coffee shop.

YOUNG MAN
What’s wrong with that? People
never rob restaurants, why not?
Bars, liquor stores, gas stations,
you get your head blown off
stickin‘ up one of them.
Restaurants, on the other hand, you
catch with their pants down.
They’re not expecting to get
robbed, or not as expecting.

YOUNG WOMAN
(taking to idea)
I bet in places like this you could
cut down on the hero factor.

YOUNG MAN
Correct. Just like banks, these
places are insured. The managers
don’t give a fuck, they’re just
tryin‘ to get ya out the door
before you start pluggin‘ diners.
Waitresses, forget it, they ain’t
takin‘ a bullet for the register.
Busboys, some wetback gettin‘ paid
a dollar fifty a hour gonna really
give a fuck you’re stealin‘ from
the owner. Customers are sittin‘
there with food in their mouths,
they don’t know what’s goin‘ on.
One minute they’re havin‘ a Denver
omelette, next minute somebody’s
stickin‘ a gun in their face.

The Young Woman visibly takes in the idea. The Young Man
continues in a low voice.

YOUNG MAN
See, I got the idea last liquor
store we stuck up. ‚Member all
those customers kept comin‘ in?

YOUNG WOMAN
Yeah.

YOUNG MAN
They you got the idea to take
everybody’s wallet.

YOUNG WOMAN
Uh-huh.

YOUNG MAN
That was a good idea.

YOUNG WOMAN
Thank you.

YOUNG MAN
We made more from the wallets then
we did the register.

YOUNG WOMAN
Yes we did.

YOUNG MAN
A lot of people go to restaurants.

YOUNG WOMAN
A lot of wallets.

YOUNG MAN
Pretty smart, huh?

The Young Woman scans the restaurant with this new
information. She sees all the PATRONS eating, lost in
conversations. The tires WAITRESS, taking orders. The
BUSBOYS going through the motions, collecting dishes. The
MANAGER complaining to the COOK about something. A smiles
breaks out on the Young Woman’s face.

YOUNG WOMAN
Pretty smart.
(into it)
I’m ready, let’s go, right here,
right now.

YOUNG MAN
Remember, same as before, you’re
crowd control, I handle the
employees.

YOUNG WOMAN
Got it.

They both take out their .32-caliber pistols and lay them on
the table. He looks at her and she back at him.

YOUNG WOMAN
I love you, Pumpkin.

YOUNG MAN
I love you, Honey Bunny.

And with that, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny grab their weapons,
stand up and rob the restaurant. Pumpkin’s robbery persona is
that of the in-control professional. Honey Bunny’s is that of
the psychopathic, hair-triggered, loose cannon.

PUMPKIN
(yelling to all)
Everybody be cool this is a
robbery!

HONEY BUNNY
Any of you fuckin‘ pricks move and
I’ll execute every one of you
motherfuckers! Got that?

PULP FICTION

2. INT. ’74 CHEVY (MOVING) – MORNING 2.

An old gas guzzling, dirty, white 1974 Chevy Nova BARRELS down
a homeless-ridden street in Hollywood. In the front seat are
two young fellas — one white, one black — both wearing cheap
black suits with thin black ties under long green dusters.
Their names are VINCENT VEGA (white) and JULES WINNFIELD
(black). Jules is behind the wheel.

JULES
— okay now, tell me about the hash
bars?

VINCENT
What so you want to know?

JULES
Well, hash is legal there, right?

VINCENT
Yeah, it’s legal, but is ain’t a
hundred percent legal. I mean you
can’t walk into a restaurant, roll
a joint, and start puffin‘ away.
You’re only supposed to smoke in
your home or certain designated
places.

JULES
Those are hash bars?

VINCENT
Yeah, it breaks down like this:
it’s legal to buy it, it’s legal to
own it and, if you’re the
proprietor of a hash bar, it’s
legal to sell it. It’s legal to
carry it, which doesn’t really
matter ‚cause — get a load of this
— if the cops stop you, it’s
illegal for this to search you.
Searching you is a right that the
cops in Amsterdam don’t have.

JULES
That did it, man — I’m fuckin‘
goin‘, that’s all there is to it.

VINCENT
You’ll dig it the most. But you
know what the funniest thing about
Europe is?

JULES
What?

VINCENT
It’s the little differences. A
lotta the same shit we got here,
they got there, but there they’re a
little different.

JULES
Examples?

VINCENT
Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy
beer in a movie theatre. And I
don’t mean in a paper cup either.
They give you a glass of beer, like
in a bar. In Paris, you can buy
beer at MacDonald’s. Also, you
know what they call a Quarter
Pounder with Cheese in Paris?

JULES
They don’t call it a Quarter
Pounder with Cheese?

VINCENT
No, they got the metric system
there, they wouldn’t know what the
fuck a Quarter Pounder is.

JULES
What’d they call it?

VINCENT
Royale with Cheese.

JULES
(repeating)
Royale with Cheese. What’d they
call a Big Mac?

VINCENT
Big Mac’s a Big Mac, but they call
it Le Big Mac.

JULES
What do they call a Whopper?

VINCENT
I dunno, I didn’t go into a Burger
King. But you know what they put
on french fries in Holland instead
of ketchup?

JULES
What?

VINCENT
Mayonnaise.

JULES
Goddamn!

VINCENT
I seen ‚em do it. And I don’t mean
a little bit on the side of the
plate, they fuckin‘ drown ‚em in
it.

JULES
Uuccch!

3. INT. CHEVY (TRUNK) – MORNING 3.

The trunk of the Chevy OPENS UP, Jules and Vincent reach
inside, taking out two .45 Automatics, loading and cocking
them.

JULES
We should have shotguns for this
kind of deal.

VINCENT
How many up there?

JULES
Three or four.

VINCENT
Counting our guy?

JULES
I’m not sure.

VINCENT
So there could be five guys up
there?

JULES
It’s possible.

VINCENT
We should have fuckin‘ shotguns.

They CLOSE the trunk.

4. EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING COURTYARD – MORNING 4.

Vincent and Jules, their long matching overcoats practically
dragging on the ground, walk through the courtyard of what
looks like a hacienda-style Hollywood apartment building.

We TRACK alongside.

VINCENT
What’s her name?

JULES
Mia.

VINCENT
How did Marsellus and her meet?

JULES
I dunno, however people meet
people. She usta be an actress.

VINCENT
She ever do anything I woulda saw?

JULES
I think her biggest deal was she
starred in a pilot.

VINCENT
What’s a pilot?

JULES
Well, you know the shows on TV?

VINCENT
I don’t watch TV.

JULES
Yes, but you’re aware that there’s
an invention called television, and
on that invention they show shows?

VINCENT
Yeah.

JULES
Well, the way they pick the shows
on TV is they make one show, and
that show’s called a pilot. And
they show that one show to the
people who pick the shows, and on
the strength of that one show, they
decide if they want to make more
shows. Some get accepted and
become TV programs, and some don’t,
and become nothing. She starred in
one of the ones that became
nothing.

They enter the apartment building.
